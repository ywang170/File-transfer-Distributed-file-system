To Start:____________________________________________________________

1. Drag files in "exe" folder to anywhere you want. Please make sure properties files and jar files are under the same folder
2. open terminal
3. run "java -jar mp3.jar"
4. First please input your port number
**Please DO REMEMBER: ANY PORT NUMBER UNDER 3000 ARE RESERVED, USING THEM MAY CASUE PROBLEM!
5. You will be asked if you are the contact machine(threshold). Type y or n( plese start contact machine first!)
6. If you are the contact machine, your machine# will be automatically set to 0, or you will be asked to input your machine number
**Please use number between 1~100 :)
7. then input your contact machine's IP and port number if you are not the contact machine
8. Done!




To Use:______________________________________________________________

1.when you see a line "Please give your order: " then you can give your order
2.orders include "get", "delete", "put", like "put a.txt b", "get c d.txt" "delete e"...
**Please DO REMEMBER: The machine will find it and report to you if you input files don't exist or your order doesn't start with delete/put/get
**But, the machine will not detect structure error with command! For example, if you input "get" with only one argument, like "get a.cpp", then the program may crash.
3.Sometimes because the samll sychronization problem, "Please give your order: " may come before information message
For example, it is supposed to show:

"blablabla done!
Please give your order: "

But it shows:

"Please give your order: 
blablabla done!"

In such case, please do not care! :)




To re-join:__________________________________________________________

If one of your machine failed, don't worry, my project has already built a folder "sdfs" that stores every file you uploaded.
Once you get back to the network, your server will automatically tell others he is back and upload information about your files to update the network. 
So Nothing will be lost no matter any machine or machines fail.( Of course if they all fail.. then... :(...)

1. Just repeat every steps in "To Start" part and it is done!!!
**You can even use a different port number or machine number, it doesn't matter. 




Have fun!!!
